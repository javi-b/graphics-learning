# graphics-learning - Vulkan
Just trying to learn Vulkan.

## Setting up
We are using Windows and Visual Studio.

The `Vulkan.7z` file contains the Vulkan SDK, include files and libraries needed to compile Vulkan projects. Unzip the folder in `C:/` and it should work. If the libraries don't work, you might need to recompile them in your own machine. Follow [vulkan-tutorial.com/](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) for that.
