The idea is to implement a series of small projects using OpenGL, we were inspired by [this article](https://medium.com/@openglprojects/opengl-project-ideas-239e0e015d).

## Setting up
We are using Windows and Visual Studio.

The `OpenGL.zip` file contains the include files and libraries needed to compile OpenGL projects. Unzip the folder in `C:/` and it should work. If the libraries don't work, you might need to recompile them in your own machine. Follow [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com) for that.
